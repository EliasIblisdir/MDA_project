         "How do longstanding, primarily non-industrial, non-capitalist societies adopt and adapt digital technologies in their daily practices and systems of values? Classical anthropological theory once arranged basic economic types on an evolutionary ladder ranging from hunter-gatherers, horticulturalists, pastoralists, and agriculturalists to industrialists. Today, the existence of these economies other than industrialism are correctly approached not as anachronisms but as contemporaneous to (post-)industrial life. Still, research on digitization has largely taken place in (post-) industrial contexts, meaning we know next to nothing about how different types of longstanding economies adopt and adapt digital technologies. At the same time, researchers have stipulated that digitization threatens global economic diversity. By comparing digitization to processes of colonization, they have argued that digital technologies facilitate assimilation into (post-)industrial economic systems and their often capitalist values by virtue of their technological design. This project empirically investigates these claims through in-depth ethnographic research among hunter-gatherers (Brazilian Amazon), pastoralists (Kyrgyz Republic), horticulturalists (Solomon Islands) and indigenous agriculturalists (India) who have long resisted assimilation into industrial-capitalism. Additional ethnological comparison of the four sites will offer unique macro-level insights into the possibilities for economic diversity in the digital age. Finally, the project advances a novel theoretical and methodological approach that advances both ethnographic research and ethnological comparison. This approach recognizes the significance of both technological design and contextual adaptations and provides tools for new research agendas not just on digital industrial-capitalism but on diverse economic systems and values.",

         "The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has ushered in a new era in observational astrochemistry. JWST's ability to obtain infrared spectra of molecular ices condensed on interstellar dust grains in dense, star-forming clouds and in protoplanetary disks is expected to revolutionize the field, since these ices are known to be important sources of complex organic molecules. On a fundamental level, the physico-chemical behavior of these ices obeys the laws of molecular quantum dynamics occurring in low-temperature condensed phases. This is a forefront research area in chemical physics that, unfortunately, remains poorly understood. This project establishes an interdisciplinary, synergistic research consortium to address this knowledge deficit, bringing together the unique expertise of the groups of Alec Wodtke (Chemical Physics at Surfaces), Liv Hornekr (Astrochemistry and Scanning Tunneling Microscopy) and Peter Saalfrank (Theoretical Quantum Dynamics). Under IRASTRO, we will develop and employ advanced infrared technology based on superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) for new experimental capability in laboratory experiments directly relevant to astrochemistry. We will combine megapixel SNSPD arrays with chelle spectrometers enabling solid-state mid-infrared emission spectroscopy, including single-molecule mid-IR spectroscopy in a scanning tunneling microscope. With these new experiments and forefront quantum theory, we will tackle three research themes: 1) Infrared Spectra of Molecules on Surfaces under Interstellar Conditions, 2) Energy Dissipation Channels on Low Temperature Surfaces, and 3) Chemical Reactivity under Interstellar Conditions. IRASTROs focus on IR spectroscopy will make the projects findings directly relevant to the interpretation of JWST observational data and, through a fruitful collaboration of experiment and theory, provide a better fundamental understanding of astrochemistry.",

         "The spatiotemporal organization of the cell material represents one of the great wonders in physics, chemistry and biology. Compartmentalization plays a key role in such precise molecular coordination and enables cellular function. Over the past decade, transformative experiments have revealed that most intracellular compartments are not enclosed by membranes, but instead they are dynamical assemblies, termed condensates, and thought to occur via liquid-liquid phase separation of biomolecules. Nevertheless, the misregulation of these condensatesmostly formed by proteins and nucleic acidscan give rise to deleterious solid-like aggregates, which are associated with the proliferation of age-related and neurodegenerative disorders.In-phase aims to develop an innovative computational approach to resolve the dynamical behaviour of molecules inside functional condensates that drift their complex physicochemical behaviour into pathological solid aggregates. To this end, we plan to develop a multiscale modelling platformcombining coarse-grained force fields and atomistic simulationswhich will address the following critical questions: What are the encoded molecular features in RNA and protein sequences regulating phase behaviour? What pushes biomolecular condensates to shift their material properties over time? Can we prevent the proliferation of pathological aggregates induced by condensate misregulation? The overarching goals of this project are: (1) to understand the thermodynamic and intermolecular forces driving condensates out-of-function; and (2) devise potential strategies for preventing RNA/protein aberrant phase transitions in biomolecular condensates. This alone is ground-breaking because it will reveal the underlying mechanisms and interactions by which the structure and sequence of RNA and proteins dictate the material properties of intracellular condensates, and their implication in cellular dysfunction.",

         "The Milky Way is the cosmic environment in which the solar system, the Earth, and life as we know it came into being. It is also the veil through which we peer into the extra-galactic universe. Its dust obscures our view of the formation of the cosmos. Its magnetic fields distort the observations of nature's most powerful particle accelerators. Its structure and metabolism determine the great diversity of observed star and planetary systems, including our own. Due to a lack of distance information, currently most information about the structure of the Milky Way is two-dimensional, while three-dimensional information is needed. For a breakthrough in Galactic cartography and the science it enables, we will create the first comprehensive three-dimensional atlas of all the physical components of the Milky Way. Our atlas will be self-consistent between component maps, quantify their remaining uncertainties, and be the most detailed to date. Thanks to the dramatic progress in observations at all wavelengths and in algorithmic methods based on information field theory in recent years, now is the right time to do this. Our team's combined expertise in galactic astrophysics, algorithms, observations, Milky Way surveys, and  information field theory with its application to galactic tomography puts us in a unique position to generate the first comprehensive Milky Way Atlas. We will apply this atlas to a number of pressing questions in cosmology, cosmic ray, and interstellar medium research and transfer the used tomography technologies into other areas, like medical imaging, Earth monitoring, and industrial data analysis.",

         "Cellular organisms are complex machines whose health and functioning are dictated by parameters including temperature, oxygen concentration, and pH. Luminescence nanosensing is a technology that promises all the features required to reliably monitor these parameters at the intracellular level: minimal invasiveness, remote working principle, and submicrometric spatial resolution. These features are ensured by the use of sub-micrometric sensors (particles) whose luminescence is sensitive to changes in the parameters to be sensed. Yet, despite the hype about luminescence nanosensing, its reliability in the study of cells is limited by interparticle variability in optical properties and sensing performance, simultaneous response to several parameters (cross-sensitivity), and lack of a measurement technology that enables fast 2D mapping of multiple parameters with sub-second temporal resolution. MAtCHLESS tackles heads on these limitations to develop a reliable luminescence sensing technology for multiparameteric sensing in cell studies. This project entails: design of a novel family of composite submicrometric luminescent sensors, elimination of interparticle fluctuations in optical properties using a spectral sorting strategy, introduction of the paradigm shift of making cross-sensitivity a desirable feature via machine learning, and use of a novel optical technology to build a setup for 2D mapping of multiple parameters with high temporal and spatial resolution. MAtCHLESS will test the reliability of the sensing approach in mammalian cell lines and extremophiles  microorganisms that can withstand extreme conditions of, e.g., temperature, oxygen concentration, and pH. These investigations will show the potential of the developed technology to monitor both slight and extreme changes in biological parameters, towards a deeper understanding of, e.g., how cancer can be more effectively treated, as well as how Life evolved on Earth and can be adapted beyond our planet.",

         "General Relativity (GR) is more than a century old, but is still our best macroscopic description of gravity. Key GR predictions are black holes (BHs) and gravitational waves (GWs), whose spectacular confirmation led to two recent physics Nobel Prizes. The future of GW astronomy, however, is even brighter, since detectors will observe BHs at cosmic dawn and probe their enigmatic event horizon, where GR clashes with quantum mechanics in the information loss paradox. These experiments will measure signals hundreds of times smaller than today, necessarily discovering anomalies and deviations from current predictions, e.g., due to the astrophysical environment. On the fundamental side, precision GW astronomy will open countless possibilities for understanding the standard model of particle physics (and its extensions), gravity and cosmology. By itself, however, precision is not knowledge. To harness the power of these measurements, a groundbreaking framework is urgently needed to solve the very nonlinear equations of GR and develop waveform models to unprecedented accuracy, and to convert these results into concrete interpretation tools. GWSky will leverage the world-leading expertise of its PIs in astrophysics, GW-source modeling, particle physics and GR, and recent paradigm shifts to build an overarching framework answering a fundamental question: When, inevitably, an anomaly in a GW signal is identified, what is it? A gravitational effect not predicted by GR? The influence of nearby matter? Or merely an imprecise calculation of the expected signal? Even tiny deviations from GR would shake physics to its core, but to claim a deviation from it, one needs to filter out first the contributions from the astrophysical environment, instrumental artifacts and systematic modeling uncertainties. GWSky will provide tools to disentangle these contributions, enabling precision GW astronomy with upcoming observational runs, and new facilities on the ground and in space.",

         "While newly printed books were circulating widely around Europe, when more than half a century had passed since Gutenbergs invention, Hernando Coln (1488-1539), second son of Christopher Columbus, undertook the extraordinary challenge of keeping physical track of the proliferation of knowledge. He not only purchased everything, incessantly, and everywhere, marking on the books place and date of purchase, the local price, and the conversion to Spanish currency; for accessing, managing and reusing his colossal library, he and his invisible technicians also developed a sophisticated cross-indexing and symbols system which is foundational in the history of bibliography and knowledge management. The Colombina library of Seville still preserves over one third of the almost 16,000 titles which Coln left at his death, as well a dozen manuscript indexes and catalogues that, recording all sorts of information, make it possible to reconstruct the lost portions of the collection, including the volumes famously shipwrecked on their way from Venice to Seville in 1521. Financing, gathering, cataloguing and managing a library of such scale required widespread connections, the support of an international network, and a vision deeply intertwined with the politics of knowledge acquisition of the new-born Spanish Empire. COLIBRI aims at opening the doors and explore the legacy of the most important library of the early modern period, completing the reconstruction of its content in order to investigate it; understanding how it worked as the first large-scale information processing system of modern times, and as a place for the production, not only for the storage and preservation, of knowledge; exploring the still new relationship between written and print culture and the early European and intercontinental book market; finally, showing how the movement and the stories of Colons books reflect the developments of Western culture of the last five centuries.",

         "In-vitro Fertilization (IVF) is a well-known fertility treatment used for infertile couples, single mothers and women in same-sex relationships. Of the nearly a million IVF cycles done in Europe annually (3 million globally), only 40% result in pregnancy. Low IVF success makes the process long, expensive, and emotionally devastating. Moreover, the dissimilar access to fertility treatments contributes to health inequity and gender imbalance, as infertility is still a women's social burden.One of the leading causes of IVF failure is embryo transfer (ET), with live birth rates (ET-LBR) below 30% and lower than 10% in women around 40 years old. The main factors affecting ET-LBR are embryo quality, uterine receptivity, and embryo-uterine synchrony. Nowadays, the selection of high-quality embryos is solved; but in the presence of high-quality embryos the uterus determines the success of embryo implantation. However, assessing the uterine readiness for embryo transfer is done by counting days.Therefore, an urgent unmet clinical need is to provide accuracy in detecting uterine receptivity and embryo-uterine synchrony to improve embryo implantation rates and IVF success.We have created Seedchrony, a point-of-care device that detects endometrial receptivity non-invasively, and instantly, enabling right-on-time embryo transfer to boost IVF success. Unlike the standard of care (counting days) and the current solutions (tissue analysis requiring tissue biopsies and time for sample processing), Seedchrony is accurate, the measurements are done directly in the uterine fluid, and the results are immediate, allowing doing test and transfer on the same day.Manina Medtech is a pre-seed stage startup with a B2B business model and the vision that every woman who goes through IVF requires a single IVF cycle to get pregnant. We position to fundamentally boost IVF success, making the whole process faster, healthier, and more affordable.",

         "The main objective of this Proposal is the organisation of the Young Talents Programme which contains two separate events. The first is the European Union Contest for Young Scientists (EUCYS) 2022. The second is the development of a pilot for next stage researchers & early career researchers with the working title EU TALENTON. Both events will be organized and held in Leiden, the Netherlands. Stichting Leiden European City of Science 2022 (Leiden2022) will be responsible for the organisation of the Young Talents Programme. The primary aim of the EU Contest for Young Scientists is to stimulate exchanges between talented young scientists, ensure that young scientists get guidance from some of the most prominent scientists in Europe and eventually to highlight scientific student achievements and attract widespread media interest. In other words, providing additional stimulus to young people who have an already demonstrated interest in applying science to solve problems.   In the 2022 edition, Leiden aims to innovate the existing EUCYS model in several ways. into a more attractive contest. Leiden2022 aims to innovate EUCYS2022 in the following ways:- Reviewing the EUCYS award system- Researching if the scope of EUCYS can be expanded towards components of the Humanities (from STEM to STEAM)- Embedding EUCYS into the public and scientific programme of Leiden European City of Science 2022 Furthermore Leiden2022 aims to reach a more mature target group that is entering the next level of their research career by organizing a pilot. With this pilots Leiden2022 will explore the possibilities for organizing the EU TALENTON, and as such create a (potential) blueprint for EU TALENTON editions to follow. Therefore, EUCYS2022 and the EU TALENTON 2022 have the potential to have long lasting impact on the future of the Young Talents Programme. With this new approach, a broader group of young people will be attracted to (academic) careers in STEM and/or STEAM fields. By giving special attention to future prospects of participants and competition winners both within and outside of academics, The Young Talents Programme is more than a scientific competition alone as it creates a broad career perspective for young students and next stage and early career researchers ranging in age between 14 and presumably 24. Therefore, the Young Talents Programme is an instrument to achieve broader impact on young talent and society beyond the competitions itself (and the events connected to it).",

The EC has been supporting a consortium of research funders called cOAlition S that have adopted an Open Access mandate for recipients of their funding called Plan S, which required cOAlition S grantees to publish all peer-reviewed articles resulting from their grant funds in open access (OA).  In the five years since Plan S was published, cOAlition S has grown from 12 founding members to 28 and the Plan S Principles have been implemented in the participating funders’ policies. We are now in a position to evaluate the first five years of Plan S and cOAlition S, and reflect on lessons learned and the road ahead.The OA-Advance project will contribute to strengthening cOAlition S as an instrument to advance the European Commission’s and participating funders’ shared vision to deliver full and immediate OA.  It will work to achieve this by assessing the impact of Plan S through an independent review, and by providing recommendations on how to build on the achievements of Plan S to support a new vision for the future of scholarly publishing.",

We do not see the European City of Science 2024 title as an end in itself, but as a key step towards building Katowice as a Real City of Science – an agile, networked science centre operating across the whole of the city. Celebrations of the European City of Science 2024 provide an excellent opportunity to “disseminate” the City of Science concept, using this event as a base to create a real legacy project for the city itself and for all of Silesia.

Since RESAVER became operational it showed that it can operate in an efficient and successful way in a large number of countries providing pensions at a low cost. Building on this success, the most significant goal of RESAVER is now to strengthen own capacities and grow in size: we will highlight a number growth objectives (promotion, implementation, partnerships, marketing & sales support and awareness ranging among interested parties).

         "The objective of the project »ERA conference« is to create a space for stakeholders to engage with the formation of the  new, revitalised European Research Area (ERA) in order to pursue the European Commission's goals of co-designing, co-creating and co-developing ERA policies with all ERA actors. This delivers against the European Commission Communication from September 2020 on A new ERA for Research and Innovation and the Council Conclusions from December 2020 on the New European Research Area.The first day of the ERA conference focuses on the Commission’s proposal for a Council Recommendation on a Pact for Research and Innovation in Europe  and the new ERA governance structure. The second day will focus on implementation challenges with stakeholders.The expected impacts of the ERA conference are: a) contributing to the Commission’s co-creation of ERA Actions (derived from the ERA policy agenda), ensuring they are designed appropriately; and b) engaging stakeholders, by giving them their own space to discuss the implementation of several actions. The overall rationale of the ERA conference is based on the high level discussion on the topic of the renewal of the ERA and strengthening relations between stakeholders and the Commission (through workshop activities on the second day of the conference). The ERA conference will also deliver promotional activities prior to the conference – with stakeholder engagement through video testimonials on the topic of the renewal of the ERA, which will be publicised alongside the conference. Additionally, after the conference, the publication of conference recommendations will contribute to the balanced development of the new ERA and could be used in further ministerial discussions on the renewal of ERA. In the time of proposal writing it is planned for the conference to be held live, however we also have a support plan in case we would have to switch to online event due to the pandemics.",

         "The overall objective of CO-VALUE is to boost uptake and deployment of research results by adopting a co-valorisation approach that strengthens the role of societal actors in knowledge valorisation. Citizen engagement will be embedded in knowledge valorisation by deploying capacity building, peer learning actions and experimentation. CO-VALUE will capitalise on and contribute to EU initiatives such as the Knowledge Valorisation Platform, through the production, testing and improvement of best practices and lessons learned in two European territories: Alicante in Spain and Emilia Romagna in Italy. In each territory, quadruple-helix stakeholders from the research & innovation ecosystem will be involved in the co-design and implementation of co-valorisation, exploiting ongoing knowledge valorisation processes such as developing innovative solutions to address the lack of raw materials and its impact on citizens’ welfare (Alicante), or specific funding schemes and projects to introduce multi-stakeholder engagement in public-funded research (Emilia Romagna).The transfer of best practices and skills will be guaranteed by a comprehensive scheme of capacity building, peer learning and shadowing opportunities, both at local and international level. The involvement of umbrella organisations such as EBN, ERRIN and universities alliances will foster a wider uptake of CO-VALUE’s trainings and tools, thus supporting the implementation of new practices by knowledge valorisation agents beyond the project consortium. Incentives for researchers to engage with society, and for society to engage with researchers will be co-designed with stakeholders in each territory and implemented throughthe involvement of local R&I public administrations. Tangible changes in local co-valorisation agents will be exploited to showcase improvements, together with a co-assessment of enabling conditions, processes and impact performed together by all stakeholders involved.",

         "Addressing major societal challenges like climate change requires a very different approach to deploying innovation. EIT Climate-KIC has developed a practical model of place-based innovation to map, co-develop and match scalable solutions to the challenge of meeting city, region, and industry climate targets.  By orchestrating key stakeholders to develop new markets related to climate challenges and by enabling a large-scale ‘learning by doing’ framework, the model mobilises public and private funding to test and produce actionable intelligence, shared learning and solutions from a portfolio of innovations. There is a considerable need for such operational models for implementing transformative climate policy ambitions within Europe and beyond.EIT and EIT Climate-KIC have identified three core capabilities to enable scale up of this “systems innovation” model commercially and so help European stakeholders meet ambitious climate goals, aiming to contribute to the avoidance of over 500million tonnes CO2e and strengthening the climate resilience of 10 million people by 2027. This proposal addresses these core capabilities, comprising investment over 2 years of: €4.7M to secure new funding and commercial sales of the ‘Systems Innovation as a Service’ model; €5.8M to strengthen EIT Climate-KIC’s core operational capabilities and refine the systems innovation business model; and €6.3M to improve the quality and scalability of the systems innovation model to new national, city and regional governments, as well as industry sectors.The primary objective of this plan - against which success will be measured - is to ensure that by the end of 2024, EIT Climate-KIC is financially sustainable and independent of EIT funding and able to scale its systems innovation model.",

The cluster currently comprises a well established and successful EIT Hub in Israel and Silicon Valley, and an additional global platform dedicated to expanding the reach of EIT to new locations was established in 2023 as will be detailed in this business plan, under the new leadership of EIT Health. A new Hub will be established in the Uk as of January 2024.The Global Outreach programme creates significant value for the EIT Community, as well as the outreach location, with tangible success stories and concrete results from the past 4 years of activity. These stand to show the significant collaborations that have been forged in each outreach location, the impact of creating significant ties between Europe and these strategic global innovation valleys. The strong brand awareness that has been carefully crafted, and the intricate thought process that has been put into creating a strong foundation for each hub.This business plan for the next three years, 2023 - 2025 builds upon this strong foundation that has been established, and lays out the groundwork for further strengthening the existing Israel hub and creating a flexible and “on demand” global platform that will further expand EIT’s global footprint. The growth of the Global Outreach programme with an additional global platform with programmes in multiple locations will be based upon the scale of successful programmes that have a strong foundation, and adapting them to the needs and risks of the local ecosystems.The BP will show the strengthening and expansion of the Global Outreach programme stands in EIT’s best interests, connecting talents, knowledge and key players worldwide to tackle societal challenges.",

So far, we gathered a set of results showing the antimetastatic potential of our new drug which mode of action would, conceptually, be able to eliminate the deadliest feature of cancer cells – their ability to invade and metastasize. This happens because the target of our drug is the cells’ foundation (ie the cytoskeleton). Thus, destroying the cytoskeleton of cells is like shaking the foundations of a house, it will be tumble-down!With the Women TechEU program we will consolidate the proof-of-concept of the drug’s efficiency against metastases through two sets of in vivo studies in nude mice, and we will start the pre-clinical studies by performing pharmacokinetics (drug absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion). Also, in view of the natural future development of our drug we will start to develop its synthesis scale-up from the milligram to the multigram scale. Women TechEU program mentoring and coaching will be also key to consolidate our business plan and to approach partners and investors towards a fundraising Level A in the near future. This level of funding (~1 M€) will enable to finish our pre-clinical studies and place R-nuucell in the position to license its international patent, one of the company’s assets (PT108082B, EA038640B1, EP3227307B1, CN107466297B, JP6726678B2, US15/533,289, under examination on Canada, Brazil and India), to a pharmaceutical company using a “business-to-business” strategy.",

         "In EU alone total length of overhead electricity lines reaches staggering 5.3 million km. That is more than 5 million km of potential fail points, that need to be inspected and maintained in order to ensure the reliability of electricity supply. Currently, these inspections are carried out by helicopters or walking inspection crews. However, the walking crews are slow and inefficient, while helicopters are expensive and damaging our climate (helicopters consume 60 liters of fuel per hour).Our solution – substituting helicopters and walking crews with our new generation unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with LiDAR , RGB and thermal cameras, combined with machine learning (ML) powered analytics, that can quickly and accurately identify defects and faults in electricity grid elements. Our team have developed a drone, capable to carry combination of sensors at the same time, designed to fly slow and at low altitude for higher data quality and inspecting  up to 300 km per day. THRUST drones are capable to fully substitute walking inspector crew and helicopters for infrastructure inspections at a fraction of a cost. Furthermore, our drones emit 171 times less CO2 per km than helicopters, and 10 times less than cars. Our drones have potential to cut EU CO2 emissions by 1.2 million tonnes of CO2 annually.With the help Women TechEU we will prepare for the next fundraising round, expand our innovation partner network and launch a media campaign to encourage more women to join aviation industry. This project objective is to position our company to be the catalyst for higher women involvement in aviation industry, through leading by example, as well as increasing THRUST scalability to become leading deep-tech start-up in drone-based infrastructure inspections.",

         "More than 12 million people worldwide suffer from chronic wounds. These open wounds need to be treated in the long term, resulting in annual costs of €27 billion. The treatment of chronic wounds is based on recurring medical examinations at intervals of 4 weeks, which include photographic documentation and a measurement of the wound. According to the current state of the art, this is simply done with a ruler, whereby the ruler is often inserted directly into the wound to assess the depth of the wound. This method not only leads to unreliable and non-reproducible results. It also takes up to 30 min. and is associated with massive pain for patients. To provide patients with relief and efficiently support wound healing, cureVision has developed a unique primary care device that enables fast and accurate documentation and analysis of chronic wounds. Our device contains multiple cameras and detectors that fully automatical analyse seven critical parameters without touching the wound itself. In addition to the wound dimensions, the integrated AI also automatically and reliably analyses the tissue components of the wound (%). Thus, for the first time, our mobile primary care device enables fast and accurate assessment for every wound to enable clinicians to adjust the therapy early. In addition to the significantly more comfortable, non-invasive examination for the patient, our device reduces the examination time by up to 60 %. The optimised therapy will reduce both treatment time and hospitalisation rates, resulting in annual cost savings of over € 40 million in Germany alone. After producing a first working MVP, we now want to produce 50 final MVPs to test and verify the functions under real conditions and make adjustments based on user feedback. Before we go to market, our device must be approved as a medical product. In addition, we will set up a reliable data protection management system. These final steps are to be achieved within the outline of the present project.",

         "In cranial magnetic resonance tomography (cMRT), the administration of contrast agent facilitates diagnosis of various pathologies such as metastases due to contrast agent enhancement. Patients undergoing a medically indicated cMRT receive 100% of the authorized contrast agent dose, i.e., 0.1 mmol of gadolinium per kg body weight. The main component of MRT contrast agent is gadolinium, which is a highly toxic rare-earth element, which has potential health side effects (inter alia allergic reactions and accumulation in the body) as well as environmental side effects (accumulation in the tap water).Due to the aforementioned issues, the reduction of contrast agent dose in cMRT is highly desirable. To tackle this issue, Katerina Deike-Hofmann from the Clinic for Neuroradiology at the University Hospital Bonn together with colleagues and collaborators from the Institute of Mathematics and Life Sciences developed an artificial intelligence (AI)-based algorithm that allows for contrast agent reduction called SmartContrast. Until today, more than 1.000 prospective data sets were acquired at seven different clinics and SmartContrast showed excellent generalizibility. Thus, Katerina Deike-Hofmann founded the relios.vision GmbH as a spin-off of the University Bonn to commercialize SmartContrast. Her goal is to advance the clinical standard by combining knowledge from the areas of medicine, mathematical image processing, computer vision, and artificial intelligence.",

This innovative technology replaces hazardous mining and processing methods, removes metals from industrial minerals in an ecological and economical way, and gives various industrial wastes a second life. At the same time, ekolive thus eliminates environmental hazards and cleans contaminated sites. In addition, the process creates a biofertilizer from the liquid residue that can completely replace hazardous pesticides, positively influences the taste of crops, and increases plant growth and yield by up to 100% and the dry mass of plants by up to 400% – for safe and healthy food production and sustainable agriculture.ekolive faces two challenges:The raw material challenge: The world-leading processing industry in the EU contributes to the transition towards a resource-efficient, sustainable society in line with the EU 2030 Agenda. For this, a sustainable supply of suitable raw materials is essential. However, despite enormous under- or untapped potentials of domestic primary and secondary resources, Europe is heavily dependent on imports – simply because there is a lack of suitable economic and ecological technologies to tap them.The challenges for a transition to sustainable agriculture – namely the reduction of the excessive use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. These are not only dangerous to humans in many ways, but are also the cause of soil degradation, killed soil microflora, unhealthy and weak plants, contaminated food and drinking water.To answer these challenges, to promote the circular economy and to save resources, innovative, economically viable and environmentally friendly techniques are required. ekolive is the first to offer a corresponding biotechnology that can be used to make both mining and agriculture more environmentally friendly and sustainable.",

         "There is a clear gap in the adoption of paediatric healthcare innovations which continues to hinder the access to such innovations.    Demand-driven policy instruments offer the possibility to overcome market failures and allow risk sharing between co-owners and investors. These include Public Procurement of Innovation (PPI) and Pre-Commercial Procurement (PCP), Value-Based Procurement (VBP), and Social Impact Bonds (SIBs).  Such demand-driven funding instruments have the potential to reduce the adoption gap in paediatric healthcare. However, these innovative funding tools are rarely used to support paediatric innovation adoption. This limited adoption of demand-driven funding tools can be attributed to several barriers which are specific to paediatric healthcare, such as the perceived high-risk and complex nature of bringing paediatric innovations to market, fragmented regulatory pathways and market access, limited market demand (low numbers of patients) and perceived small impact. Additionally, there is poor awareness, knowledge and understanding of demand-driven tools, which results in their underutilisation.  The i4KIDS-LEGACY project will create a holistic innovation action plan in paediatrics to ensure optimal implementation and utilisation of demand-driven innovation financing instruments to support the adoption of paediatric innovation in a coordinated manner across Europe.  The project will:  1) Identify demand-driven financing instruments and mechanisms for paediatric health.2) Collect data on the needs and challenges in the adoption of paediatric innovation.3) Develop working groups to ideate solutions that address the needs and challenges identified.4) Collaboratively build a European action plan to catalyse the use of demand-driven tools for the adoption of paediatric innovation solutions.5)Promote cross-border adoption of paediatric innovations using financial instruments.",

         "The Building Capacities in Innovation Procurement for Cities (BUILD) project will roll out a number of training and capacity building actions targeted at upskilling the public procurers on the topic of innovation procurement. Public procurement is a powerful instrument to drive faster adoption of innovation among public sector users while simultaneously promoting economic growth by providing innovative companies opportunity for first user references. The strategic use of procurement to boost demand for innovative goods of services has become an important part of the innovation policy agenda in many EU countries, and is at the core of the new EU public procurement directive (2014/24/EU), which underlines importance of opening opportunities for public procurement of innovation (e.g. by introducing a new innovation partnership procedure). BUILD integrates the highest-quality capacity-building tools to facilitate the roll-out of capacity building and training services to cities. BUILD will engage and train public – private procurers, SMEs and startups via both onsite and online avenues on a number of topics like; 1) Guiding Principles (Valonia) 2) Legal Knowledge and Procedures (Rotterdam) 3) Preliminary market consultation (CE) 4) Pre-commercial procurement (Turku) 5) Competitive dialogue (Turku) 6) Competitive procedure with negotiation (Tartu) 7) Innovation partnership (Valonia) 8) Legal questions and considerations (Rotterdam) and 9) Risk assessment (Valonia). Lastly, BUILD will link and establish synergies with research and innovation projects funded by the EU (via Horizon Europe or other EU funding programmes), with specific focus on EU funded projects fostering PPI, with the aim of facilitating mutual learning and knowledge exchange and will also set up a pro-active dissemination action which will facilitate outreach to key target audiences, namely; public and private buyers, public-owned enterprises, SMEs and start-ups, research institutions among others.",

         "Social innovation actors take on an important role in finding solutions for societal challenges. However, many social enterprises lack entrepreneurial skills and digitization of their products or services and there is still a lack of support for social entrepreneurs, which is due to the fact that many business support organisations have little understanding of the specific challenges and needs of social entrepreneurs. The social innovation and the technology innovation ecosystems are currently not well interconnected and mostly considered separate ecosystems with different skillsets. The POSITIVE project will counteract these factors by raising awareness about the benefits of social innovation and providing capacity building about social innovation and social entrepreneurship to the tech innovation ecosystem, thus creating the basis for better support for social entrepreneurs and a more inclusive innovation ecosystem based on mutual understanding. The project will also provide new opportunities for social entrepreneurs to digitise their products and services and to acquire new business skills through the organisation of an Open Innovation Challenge in three countries (POSITIVE Impact Challenge), which constitutes knowledge transfer from the tech into the social innovation ecosystem, with the specific purpose to support regional SI actors to access alternative means of financing. The POSITIVE project will also foster the interlinkage of the two ecosystems on a regional and European level through cross-fertilization, knowledge exchange and policy recommendations on how the POSITIVE Impact Challenge model can be replicated. Thus, the POSITIVE project can not only contribute to the strengthening of the social economy on different levels, but also make the tech innovation ecosystem more resilient and equipped to tackle the important societal challenges by including social innovation actors.",

         "Europe has been in the forefront for research and innovation, even though at different paces depending on specific location. In this context, ACCELERO – Accelerating Local Innovation Ecosystems in Europe aims at contributing to reverse the unbalanced business activity in Europe by increasing the attractiveness of (less advanced) ecosystems: making ‘modest’ and ‘moderate’ innovation ecosystems more attractive to local startups that will benefit from a strong local support and avoid relocation to EU hubs as well to international companies interested in setting up their businesses outside the established and well-known centres. It also aims at tapping into the potential of local ecosystems through co-designed programmes of activities proposed jointly by business acceleration entities located in less connected innovation ecosystems (‘modest’ and ‘moderate’) and innovation hubs (‘strong innovators’ and innovation leaders’), to improve the quality of business acceleration services, their network outreach and scale-up support. ACCELERO has the ambition of creating a pan-European community of business support organisations (BSOs) as the one-stop shop for all BSOs and its “customers”, the startups and SMEs, as well as for peer-to-peer exchange, networking and connectedness for all stakeholders engaged in the broader innovation ecosystem. This will be achieved with an initial ACCELERO extended community apart from consortium members to co-create and pilot-test high-quality business acceleration services with European BSOs from emerging and moderate innovators together with experts from strong and leader innovation regions or Member States, followed by the launch of the community inside Euroquity platform.",

         "ERC-2023-STG",
         "How do longstanding, primarily non-industrial, non-capitalist societies adopt and adapt digital technologies in their daily practices and systems of values? Classical anthropological theory once arranged basic economic types on an evolutionary ladder ranging from hunter-gatherers, horticulturalists, pastoralists, and agriculturalists to industrialists. Today, the existence of these economies other than industrialism are correctly approached not as anachronisms but as contemporaneous to (post-)industrial life. Still, research on digitization has largely taken place in (post-) industrial contexts, meaning we know next to nothing about how different types of longstanding economies adopt and adapt digital technologies. At the same time, researchers have stipulated that digitization threatens global economic diversity. By comparing digitization to processes of colonization, they have argued that digital technologies facilitate assimilation into (post-)industrial economic systems and their often capitalist values by virtue of their technological design. This project empirically investigates these claims through in-depth ethnographic research among hunter-gatherers (Brazilian Amazon), pastoralists (Kyrgyz Republic), horticulturalists (Solomon Islands) and indigenous agriculturalists (India) who have long resisted assimilation into industrial-capitalism. Additional ethnological comparison of the four sites will offer unique macro-level insights into the possibilities for economic diversity in the digital age. Finally, the project advances a novel theoretical and methodological approach that advances both ethnographic research and ethnological comparison. This approach recognizes the significance of both technological design and contextual adaptations and provides tools for new research agendas not just on digital industrial-capitalism but on diverse economic systems and values.",

         "ERC-2024-SyG",
         "The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has ushered in a new era in observational astrochemistry. JWST's ability to obtain infrared spectra of molecular ices condensed on interstellar dust grains in dense, star-forming clouds and in protoplanetary disks is expected to revolutionize the field, since these ices are known to be important sources of complex organic molecules. On a fundamental level, the physico-chemical behavior of these ices obeys the laws of molecular quantum dynamics occurring in low-temperature condensed phases. This is a forefront research area in chemical physics that, unfortunately, remains poorly understood. This project establishes an interdisciplinary, synergistic research consortium to address this knowledge deficit, bringing together the unique expertise of the groups of Alec Wodtke (Chemical Physics at Surfaces), Liv Hornekr (Astrochemistry and Scanning Tunneling Microscopy) and Peter Saalfrank (Theoretical Quantum Dynamics). Under IRASTRO, we will develop and employ advanced infrared technology based on superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) for new experimental capability in laboratory experiments directly relevant to astrochemistry. We will combine megapixel SNSPD arrays with chelle spectrometers enabling solid-state mid-infrared emission spectroscopy, including single-molecule mid-IR spectroscopy in a scanning tunneling microscope. With these new experiments and forefront quantum theory, we will tackle three research themes: 1) Infrared Spectra of Molecules on Surfaces under Interstellar Conditions, 2) Energy Dissipation Channels on Low Temperature Surfaces, and 3) Chemical Reactivity under Interstellar Conditions. IRASTROs focus on IR spectroscopy will make the projects findings directly relevant to the interpretation of JWST observational data and, through a fruitful collaboration of experiment and theory, provide a better fundamental understanding of astrochemistry.",

         "ERC-2024-STG",
         "The spatiotemporal organization of the cell material represents one of the great wonders in physics, chemistry and biology. Compartmentalization plays a key role in such precise molecular coordination and enables cellular function. Over the past decade, transformative experiments have revealed that most intracellular compartments are not enclosed by membranes, but instead they are dynamical assemblies, termed condensates, and thought to occur via liquid-liquid phase separation of biomolecules. Nevertheless, the misregulation of these condensatesmostly formed by proteins and nucleic acidscan give rise to deleterious solid-like aggregates, which are associated with the proliferation of age-related and neurodegenerative disorders.In-phase aims to develop an innovative computational approach to resolve the dynamical behaviour of molecules inside functional condensates that drift their complex physicochemical behaviour into pathological solid aggregates. To this end, we plan to develop a multiscale modelling platformcombining coarse-grained force fields and atomistic simulationswhich will address the following critical questions: What are the encoded molecular features in RNA and protein sequences regulating phase behaviour? What pushes biomolecular condensates to shift their material properties over time? Can we prevent the proliferation of pathological aggregates induced by condensate misregulation? The overarching goals of this project are: (1) to understand the thermodynamic and intermolecular forces driving condensates out-of-function; and (2) devise potential strategies for preventing RNA/protein aberrant phase transitions in biomolecular condensates. This alone is ground-breaking because it will reveal the underlying mechanisms and interactions by which the structure and sequence of RNA and proteins dictate the material properties of intracellular condensates, and their implication in cellular dysfunction.",

         "The Milky Way is the cosmic environment in which the solar system, the Earth, and life as we know it came into being. It is also the veil through which we peer into the extra-galactic universe. Its dust obscures our view of the formation of the cosmos. Its magnetic fields distort the observations of nature's most powerful particle accelerators. Its structure and metabolism determine the great diversity of observed star and planetary systems, including our own. Due to a lack of distance information, currently most information about the structure of the Milky Way is two-dimensional, while three-dimensional information is needed. For a breakthrough in Galactic cartography and the science it enables, we will create the first comprehensive three-dimensional atlas of all the physical components of the Milky Way. Our atlas will be self-consistent between component maps, quantify their remaining uncertainties, and be the most detailed to date. Thanks to the dramatic progress in observations at all wavelengths and in algorithmic methods based on information field theory in recent years, now is the right time to do this. Our team's combined expertise in galactic astrophysics, algorithms, observations, Milky Way surveys, and  information field theory with its application to galactic tomography puts us in a unique position to generate the first comprehensive Milky Way Atlas. We will apply this atlas to a number of pressing questions in cosmology, cosmic ray, and interstellar medium research and transfer the used tomography technologies into other areas, like medical imaging, Earth monitoring, and industrial data analysis.",

         "ERC-2024-STG",
         "Cellular organisms are complex machines whose health and functioning are dictated by parameters including temperature, oxygen concentration, and pH. Luminescence nanosensing is a technology that promises all the features required to reliably monitor these parameters at the intracellular level: minimal invasiveness, remote working principle, and submicrometric spatial resolution. These features are ensured by the use of sub-micrometric sensors (particles) whose luminescence is sensitive to changes in the parameters to be sensed. Yet, despite the hype about luminescence nanosensing, its reliability in the study of cells is limited by interparticle variability in optical properties and sensing performance, simultaneous response to several parameters (cross-sensitivity), and lack of a measurement technology that enables fast 2D mapping of multiple parameters with sub-second temporal resolution. MAtCHLESS tackles heads on these limitations to develop a reliable luminescence sensing technology for multiparameteric sensing in cell studies. This project entails: design of a novel family of composite submicrometric luminescent sensors, elimination of interparticle fluctuations in optical properties using a spectral sorting strategy, introduction of the paradigm shift of making cross-sensitivity a desirable feature via machine learning, and use of a novel optical technology to build a setup for 2D mapping of multiple parameters with high temporal and spatial resolution. MAtCHLESS will test the reliability of the sensing approach in mammalian cell lines and extremophiles  microorganisms that can withstand extreme conditions of, e.g., temperature, oxygen concentration, and pH. These investigations will show the potential of the developed technology to monitor both slight and extreme changes in biological parameters, towards a deeper understanding of, e.g., how cancer can be more effectively treated, as well as how Life evolved on Earth and can be adapted beyond our planet.",

         "General Relativity (GR) is more than a century old, but is still our best macroscopic description of gravity. Key GR predictions are black holes (BHs) and gravitational waves (GWs), whose spectacular confirmation led to two recent physics Nobel Prizes. The future of GW astronomy, however, is even brighter, since detectors will observe BHs at cosmic dawn and probe their enigmatic event horizon, where GR clashes with quantum mechanics in the information loss paradox. These experiments will measure signals hundreds of times smaller than today, necessarily discovering anomalies and deviations from current predictions, e.g., due to the astrophysical environment. On the fundamental side, precision GW astronomy will open countless possibilities for understanding the standard model of particle physics (and its extensions), gravity and cosmology. By itself, however, precision is not knowledge. To harness the power of these measurements, a groundbreaking framework is urgently needed to solve the very nonlinear equations of GR and develop waveform models to unprecedented accuracy, and to convert these results into concrete interpretation tools. GWSky will leverage the world-leading expertise of its PIs in astrophysics, GW-source modeling, particle physics and GR, and recent paradigm shifts to build an overarching framework answering a fundamental question: When, inevitably, an anomaly in a GW signal is identified, what is it? A gravitational effect not predicted by GR? The influence of nearby matter? Or merely an imprecise calculation of the expected signal? Even tiny deviations from GR would shake physics to its core, but to claim a deviation from it, one needs to filter out first the contributions from the astrophysical environment, instrumental artifacts and systematic modeling uncertainties. GWSky will provide tools to disentangle these contributions, enabling precision GW astronomy with upcoming observational runs, and new facilities on the ground and in space.",

         "While newly printed books were circulating widely around Europe, when more than half a century had passed since Gutenbergs invention, Hernando Coln (1488-1539), second son of Christopher Columbus, undertook the extraordinary challenge of keeping physical track of the proliferation of knowledge. He not only purchased everything, incessantly, and everywhere, marking on the books place and date of purchase, the local price, and the conversion to Spanish currency; for accessing, managing and reusing his colossal library, he and his invisible technicians also developed a sophisticated cross-indexing and symbols system which is foundational in the history of bibliography and knowledge management. The Colombina library of Seville still preserves over one third of the almost 16,000 titles which Coln left at his death, as well a dozen manuscript indexes and catalogues that, recording all sorts of information, make it possible to reconstruct the lost portions of the collection, including the volumes famously shipwrecked on their way from Venice to Seville in 1521. Financing, gathering, cataloguing and managing a library of such scale required widespread connections, the support of an international network, and a vision deeply intertwined with the politics of knowledge acquisition of the new-born Spanish Empire. COLIBRI aims at opening the doors and explore the legacy of the most important library of the early modern period, completing the reconstruction of its content in order to investigate it; understanding how it worked as the first large-scale information processing system of modern times, and as a place for the production, not only for the storage and preservation, of knowledge; exploring the still new relationship between written and print culture and the early European and intercontinental book market; finally, showing how the movement and the stories of Colons books reflect the developments of Western culture of the last five centuries.",

         "HORIZON-EIE-2022-SCALEUP-02-02",
         "In-vitro Fertilization (IVF) is a well-known fertility treatment used for infertile couples, single mothers and women in same-sex relationships. Of the nearly a million IVF cycles done in Europe annually (3 million globally), only 40% result in pregnancy. Low IVF success makes the process long, expensive, and emotionally devastating. Moreover, the dissimilar access to fertility treatments contributes to health inequity and gender imbalance, as infertility is still a women's social burden.One of the leading causes of IVF failure is embryo transfer (ET), with live birth rates (ET-LBR) below 30% and lower than 10% in women around 40 years old. The main factors affecting ET-LBR are embryo quality, uterine receptivity, and embryo-uterine synchrony. Nowadays, the selection of high-quality embryos is solved; but in the presence of high-quality embryos the uterus determines the success of embryo implantation. However, assessing the uterine readiness for embryo transfer is done by counting days.Therefore, an urgent unmet clinical need is to provide accuracy in detecting uterine receptivity and embryo-uterine synchrony to improve embryo implantation rates and IVF success.We have created Seedchrony, a point-of-care device that detects endometrial receptivity non-invasively, and instantly, enabling right-on-time embryo transfer to boost IVF success. Unlike the standard of care (counting days) and the current solutions (tissue analysis requiring tissue biopsies and time for sample processing), Seedchrony is accurate, the measurements are done directly in the uterine fluid, and the results are immediate, allowing doing test and transfer on the same day.Manina Medtech is a pre-seed stage startup with a B2B business model and the vision that every woman who goes through IVF requires a single IVF cycle to get pregnant. We position to fundamentally boost IVF success, making the whole process faster, healthier, and more affordable.",

         "The main objective of this Proposal is the organisation of the Young Talents Programme which contains two separate events. The first is the European Union Contest for Young Scientists (EUCYS) 2022. The second is the development of a pilot for next stage researchers & early career researchers with the working title EU TALENTON. Both events will be organized and held in Leiden, the Netherlands. Stichting Leiden European City of Science 2022 (Leiden2022) will be responsible for the organisation of the Young Talents Programme. The primary aim of the EU Contest for Young Scientists is to stimulate exchanges between talented young scientists, ensure that young scientists get guidance from some of the most prominent scientists in Europe and eventually to highlight scientific student achievements and attract widespread media interest. In other words, providing additional stimulus to young people who have an already demonstrated interest in applying science to solve problems.   In the 2022 edition, Leiden aims to innovate the existing EUCYS model in several ways. into a more attractive contest. Leiden2022 aims to innovate EUCYS2022 in the following ways:- Reviewing the EUCYS award system- Researching if the scope of EUCYS can be expanded towards components of the Humanities (from STEM to STEAM)- Embedding EUCYS into the public and scientific programme of Leiden European City of Science 2022 Furthermore Leiden2022 aims to reach a more mature target group that is entering the next level of their research career by organizing a pilot. With this pilots Leiden2022 will explore the possibilities for organizing the EU TALENTON, and as such create a (potential) blueprint for EU TALENTON editions to follow. Therefore, EUCYS2022 and the EU TALENTON 2022 have the potential to have long lasting impact on the future of the Young Talents Programme. With this new approach, a broader group of young people will be attracted to (academic) careers in STEM and/or STEAM fields. By giving special attention to future prospects of participants and competition winners both within and outside of academics, The Young Talents Programme is more than a scientific competition alone as it creates a broad career perspective for young students and next stage and early career researchers ranging in age between 14 and presumably 24. Therefore, the Young Talents Programme is an instrument to achieve broader impact on young talent and society beyond the competitions itself (and the events connected to it).",

In the five years since Plan S was published, cOAlition S has grown from 12 founding members to 28 and the Plan S Principles have been implemented in the participating funders’ policies. We are now in a position to evaluate the first five years of Plan S and cOAlition S, and reflect on lessons learned and the road ahead.The OA-Advance project will contribute to strengthening cOAlition S as an instrument to advance the European Commission’s and participating funders’ shared vision to deliver full and immediate OA.

This four missions will be implemented in Katowice by the end of 2024 together by the City of Katowice and the the Academic Consortium Katowice – City of Science, consisting of: Karol Szymanowski Academy of Music in Katowice, Academy of Fine Arts and Design in Katowice, Jerzy Kukuczka Academy of Physical Education, University of Economics in Katowice, Silesian University of Technology, Medical University of Silesia in Katowice, and University of Silesia in Katowice (leader of the consortium). The direct goal is to use science and higher education as a tool for transformation of the the City and region in order to improve the quality of life for the inhabitants  and to ensure dynamic development thorought the region of Silesia. We do not see the European City of Science 2024 title as an end in itself, but as a key step towards building Katowice as a Real City of Science – an agile, networked science centre operating across the whole of the city. Celebrations of the European City of Science 2024 provide an excellent opportunity to “disseminate” the City of Science concept, using this event as a base to create a real legacy project for the city itself and for all of Silesia. We are opening up our universities to create a world-class programme of societal engagement with science, technology and innovation.

         "The objective of the project »ERA conference« is to create a space for stakeholders to engage with the formation of the  new, revitalised European Research Area (ERA) in order to pursue the European Commission's goals of co-designing, co-creating and co-developing ERA policies with all ERA actors. This delivers against the European Commission Communication from September 2020 on A new ERA for Research and Innovation and the Council Conclusions from December 2020 on the New European Research Area.The first day of the ERA conference focuses on the Commission’s proposal for a Council Recommendation on a Pact for Research and Innovation in Europe  and the new ERA governance structure. The second day will focus on implementation challenges with stakeholders.The expected impacts of the ERA conference are: a) contributing to the Commission’s co-creation of ERA Actions (derived from the ERA policy agenda), ensuring they are designed appropriately; and b) engaging stakeholders, by giving them their own space to discuss the implementation of several actions. The overall rationale of the ERA conference is based on the high level discussion on the topic of the renewal of the ERA and strengthening relations between stakeholders and the Commission (through workshop activities on the second day of the conference). The ERA conference will also deliver promotional activities prior to the conference – with stakeholder engagement through video testimonials on the topic of the renewal of the ERA, which will be publicised alongside the conference. Additionally, after the conference, the publication of conference recommendations will contribute to the balanced development of the new ERA and could be used in further ministerial discussions on the renewal of ERA. In the time of proposal writing it is planned for the conference to be held live, however we also have a support plan in case we would have to switch to online event due to the pandemics.",

         "The overall objective of CO-VALUE is to boost uptake and deployment of research results by adopting a co-valorisation approach that strengthens the role of societal actors in knowledge valorisation. Citizen engagement will be embedded in knowledge valorisation by deploying capacity building, peer learning actions and experimentation. CO-VALUE will capitalise on and contribute to EU initiatives such as the Knowledge Valorisation Platform, through the production, testing and improvement of best practices and lessons learned in two European territories: Alicante in Spain and Emilia Romagna in Italy. In each territory, quadruple-helix stakeholders from the research & innovation ecosystem will be involved in the co-design and implementation of co-valorisation, exploiting ongoing knowledge valorisation processes such as developing innovative solutions to address the lack of raw materials and its impact on citizens’ welfare (Alicante), or specific funding schemes and projects to introduce multi-stakeholder engagement in public-funded research (Emilia Romagna).The transfer of best practices and skills will be guaranteed by a comprehensive scheme of capacity building, peer learning and shadowing opportunities, both at local and international level. The involvement of umbrella organisations such as EBN, ERRIN and universities alliances will foster a wider uptake of CO-VALUE’s trainings and tools, thus supporting the implementation of new practices by knowledge valorisation agents beyond the project consortium. Incentives for researchers to engage with society, and for society to engage with researchers will be co-designed with stakeholders in each territory and implemented throughthe involvement of local R&I public administrations. Tangible changes in local co-valorisation agents will be exploited to showcase improvements, together with a co-assessment of enabling conditions, processes and impact performed together by all stakeholders involved.",

         "Addressing major societal challenges like climate change requires a very different approach to deploying innovation. EIT Climate-KIC has developed a practical model of place-based innovation to map, co-develop and match scalable solutions to the challenge of meeting city, region, and industry climate targets.  By orchestrating key stakeholders to develop new markets related to climate challenges and by enabling a large-scale ‘learning by doing’ framework, the model mobilises public and private funding to test and produce actionable intelligence, shared learning and solutions from a portfolio of innovations. There is a considerable need for such operational models for implementing transformative climate policy ambitions within Europe and beyond.EIT and EIT Climate-KIC have identified three core capabilities to enable scale up of this “systems innovation” model commercially and so help European stakeholders meet ambitious climate goals, aiming to contribute to the avoidance of over 500million tonnes CO2e and strengthening the climate resilience of 10 million people by 2027. This proposal addresses these core capabilities, comprising investment over 2 years of: €4.7M to secure new funding and commercial sales of the ‘Systems Innovation as a Service’ model; €5.8M to strengthen EIT Climate-KIC’s core operational capabilities and refine the systems innovation business model; and €6.3M to improve the quality and scalability of the systems innovation model to new national, city and regional governments, as well as industry sectors.The primary objective of this plan - against which success will be measured - is to ensure that by the end of 2024, EIT Climate-KIC is financially sustainable and independent of EIT funding and able to scale its systems innovation model.",

         "R-nuucell is developing a new drug to treat Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) for which there is not any specific and efficient treatment in the market, making this disease an unmet clinical need.The aggressivity of TNBC is due to the easiness of its metastization expanding the cancer through the body inevitably leading to death. So far, we gathered a set of results showing the antimetastatic potential of our new drug which mode of action would, conceptually, be able to eliminate the deadliest feature of cancer cells – their ability to invade and metastasize. This happens because the target of our drug is the cells’ foundation (ie the cytoskeleton). Thus, destroying the cytoskeleton of cells is like shaking the foundations of a house, it will be tumble-down!With the Women TechEU program we will consolidate the proof-of-concept of the drug’s efficiency against metastases through two sets of in vivo studies in nude mice, and we will start the pre-clinical studies by performing pharmacokinetics (drug absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion). Also, in view of the natural future development of our drug we will start to develop its synthesis scale-up from the milligram to the multigram scale. Women TechEU program mentoring and coaching will be also key to consolidate our business plan and to approach partners and investors towards a fundraising Level A in the near future. This level of funding (~1 M€) will enable to finish our pre-clinical studies and place R-nuucell in the position to license its international patent, one of the company’s assets (PT108082B, EA038640B1, EP3227307B1, CN107466297B, JP6726678B2, US15/533,289, under examination on Canada, Brazil and India), to a pharmaceutical company using a “business-to-business” strategy.",

         "In EU alone total length of overhead electricity lines reaches staggering 5.3 million km. That is more than 5 million km of potential fail points, that need to be inspected and maintained in order to ensure the reliability of electricity supply. Currently, these inspections are carried out by helicopters or walking inspection crews. However, the walking crews are slow and inefficient, while helicopters are expensive and damaging our climate (helicopters consume 60 liters of fuel per hour).Our solution – substituting helicopters and walking crews with our new generation unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with LiDAR , RGB and thermal cameras, combined with machine learning (ML) powered analytics, that can quickly and accurately identify defects and faults in electricity grid elements. Our team have developed a drone, capable to carry combination of sensors at the same time, designed to fly slow and at low altitude for higher data quality and inspecting  up to 300 km per day. THRUST drones are capable to fully substitute walking inspector crew and helicopters for infrastructure inspections at a fraction of a cost. Furthermore, our drones emit 171 times less CO2 per km than helicopters, and 10 times less than cars. Our drones have potential to cut EU CO2 emissions by 1.2 million tonnes of CO2 annually.With the help Women TechEU we will prepare for the next fundraising round, expand our innovation partner network and launch a media campaign to encourage more women to join aviation industry. This project objective is to position our company to be the catalyst for higher women involvement in aviation industry, through leading by example, as well as increasing THRUST scalability to become leading deep-tech start-up in drone-based infrastructure inspections.",

         "Mobile Primary Care Device for Documentation and Analysis of Chronic Wounds - Market Transition",
         "HORIZON-EIE-2022-SCALEUP-02-02",
         "More than 12 million people worldwide suffer from chronic wounds. These open wounds need to be treated in the long term, resulting in annual costs of €27 billion. The treatment of chronic wounds is based on recurring medical examinations at intervals of 4 weeks, which include photographic documentation and a measurement of the wound. According to the current state of the art, this is simply done with a ruler, whereby the ruler is often inserted directly into the wound to assess the depth of the wound. This method not only leads to unreliable and non-reproducible results. It also takes up to 30 min. and is associated with massive pain for patients. To provide patients with relief and efficiently support wound healing, cureVision has developed a unique primary care device that enables fast and accurate documentation and analysis of chronic wounds. Our device contains multiple cameras and detectors that fully automatical analyse seven critical parameters without touching the wound itself. In addition to the wound dimensions, the integrated AI also automatically and reliably analyses the tissue components of the wound (%). Thus, for the first time, our mobile primary care device enables fast and accurate assessment for every wound to enable clinicians to adjust the therapy early. In addition to the significantly more comfortable, non-invasive examination for the patient, our device reduces the examination time by up to 60 %. The optimised therapy will reduce both treatment time and hospitalisation rates, resulting in annual cost savings of over € 40 million in Germany alone. After producing a first working MVP, we now want to produce 50 final MVPs to test and verify the functions under real conditions and make adjustments based on user feedback. Before we go to market, our device must be approved as a medical product. In addition, we will set up a reliable data protection management system. These final steps are to be achieved within the outline of the present project.",

Its mission is to simplify and streamline monitoring in the European Open Science ecosystem, to bring a common understanding on how to collect and interpret data appropriate for monitoring, as well as to assist policymakers and research executives across Europe in understanding, shaping, and aligning Open Science and related policies and their implementation.Starting from the current EOSC Observatory developed during the EOSC Future project (TRL7), EOSC Track will transform the service into TRL9, making it an open, secure and trusted platform to serve as the go-to place for Open Science monitoring Europe. It will enhance it with features to improve usability, engagement and collaboration: automate data ingestion from trusted sources such as the OpenAIRE Graph, incorporate collaborative editing and validation of data, add interactive navigation and search, visualisations. It will complement with the EOS Resources Registry which will serve as a learning tool by including narratives from experts to demonstrate the internal processes towards the OS implementation in a country, and stories for impact or best practice.EOSC Track will explore the sustainability of the EOS Observatory by fostering a co-design process with the EOSC tripartite partnership and other interested stakeholders. The objective is to align various monitoring initiatives, offer practical assistance in data collection, and generate 360o reports to establish a de-facto hub for all information around monitoring Open Science and EOSC in Europe. Fast forwarding to 2027, EOSC Track will facilitate a dialogue with the EOSC tripartite Governance to develop a roadmap for ensuring long-term sustainability.",

         "HORIZON-EIE-2022-SCALEUP-02-02",
         "In cranial magnetic resonance tomography (cMRT), the administration of contrast agent facilitates diagnosis of various pathologies such as metastases due to contrast agent enhancement. Patients undergoing a medically indicated cMRT receive 100% of the authorized contrast agent dose, i.e., 0.1 mmol of gadolinium per kg body weight. The main component of MRT contrast agent is gadolinium, which is a highly toxic rare-earth element, which has potential health side effects (inter alia allergic reactions and accumulation in the body) as well as environmental side effects (accumulation in the tap water).Due to the aforementioned issues, the reduction of contrast agent dose in cMRT is highly desirable. To tackle this issue, Katerina Deike-Hofmann from the Clinic for Neuroradiology at the University Hospital Bonn together with colleagues and collaborators from the Institute of Mathematics and Life Sciences developed an artificial intelligence (AI)-based algorithm that allows for contrast agent reduction called SmartContrast. Until today, more than 1.000 prospective data sets were acquired at seven different clinics and SmartContrast showed excellent generalizibility. Thus, Katerina Deike-Hofmann founded the relios.vision GmbH as a spin-off of the University Bonn to commercialize SmartContrast. Her goal is to advance the clinical standard by combining knowledge from the areas of medicine, mathematical image processing, computer vision, and artificial intelligence.",

This innovative technology replaces hazardous mining and processing methods, removes metals from industrial minerals in an ecological and economical way, and gives various industrial wastes a second life. At the same time, ekolive thus eliminates environmental hazards and cleans contaminated sites. In addition, the process creates a biofertilizer from the liquid residue that can completely replace hazardous pesticides, positively influences the taste of crops, and increases plant growth and yield by up to 100% and the dry mass of plants by up to 400% – for safe and healthy food production and sustainable agriculture.ekolive faces two challenges:The raw material challenge: The world-leading processing industry in the EU contributes to the transition towards a resource-efficient, sustainable society in line with the EU 2030 Agenda. For this, a sustainable supply of suitable raw materials is essential. However, despite enormous under- or untapped potentials of domestic primary and secondary resources, Europe is heavily dependent on imports – simply because there is a lack of suitable economic and ecological technologies to tap them.The challenges for a transition to sustainable agriculture – namely the reduction of the excessive use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. These are not only dangerous to humans in many ways, but are also the cause of soil degradation, killed soil microflora, unhealthy and weak plants, contaminated food and drinking water.To answer these challenges, to promote the circular economy and to save resources, innovative, economically viable and environmentally friendly techniques are required. ekolive is the first to offer a corresponding biotechnology that can be used to make both mining and agriculture more environmentally friendly and sustainable.",

         "HORIZON-EIE-2023-CONNECT-01-02",
         "There is a clear gap in the adoption of paediatric healthcare innovations which continues to hinder the access to such innovations.    Demand-driven policy instruments offer the possibility to overcome market failures and allow risk sharing between co-owners and investors. These include Public Procurement of Innovation (PPI) and Pre-Commercial Procurement (PCP), Value-Based Procurement (VBP), and Social Impact Bonds (SIBs).  Such demand-driven funding instruments have the potential to reduce the adoption gap in paediatric healthcare. However, these innovative funding tools are rarely used to support paediatric innovation adoption. This limited adoption of demand-driven funding tools can be attributed to several barriers which are specific to paediatric healthcare, such as the perceived high-risk and complex nature of bringing paediatric innovations to market, fragmented regulatory pathways and market access, limited market demand (low numbers of patients) and perceived small impact. Additionally, there is poor awareness, knowledge and understanding of demand-driven tools, which results in their underutilisation.  The i4KIDS-LEGACY project will create a holistic innovation action plan in paediatrics to ensure optimal implementation and utilisation of demand-driven innovation financing instruments to support the adoption of paediatric innovation in a coordinated manner across Europe.  The project will:  1) Identify demand-driven financing instruments and mechanisms for paediatric health.2) Collect data on the needs and challenges in the adoption of paediatric innovation.3) Develop working groups to ideate solutions that address the needs and challenges identified.4) Collaboratively build a European action plan to catalyse the use of demand-driven tools for the adoption of paediatric innovation solutions.5)Promote cross-border adoption of paediatric innovations using financial instruments.",

         "The Building Capacities in Innovation Procurement for Cities (BUILD) project will roll out a number of training and capacity building actions targeted at upskilling the public procurers on the topic of innovation procurement. Public procurement is a powerful instrument to drive faster adoption of innovation among public sector users while simultaneously promoting economic growth by providing innovative companies opportunity for first user references. The strategic use of procurement to boost demand for innovative goods of services has become an important part of the innovation policy agenda in many EU countries, and is at the core of the new EU public procurement directive (2014/24/EU), which underlines importance of opening opportunities for public procurement of innovation (e.g. by introducing a new innovation partnership procedure). BUILD integrates the highest-quality capacity-building tools to facilitate the roll-out of capacity building and training services to cities. BUILD will engage and train public – private procurers, SMEs and startups via both onsite and online avenues on a number of topics like; 1) Guiding Principles (Valonia) 2) Legal Knowledge and Procedures (Rotterdam) 3) Preliminary market consultation (CE) 4) Pre-commercial procurement (Turku) 5) Competitive dialogue (Turku) 6) Competitive procedure with negotiation (Tartu) 7) Innovation partnership (Valonia) 8) Legal questions and considerations (Rotterdam) and 9) Risk assessment (Valonia). Lastly, BUILD will link and establish synergies with research and innovation projects funded by the EU (via Horizon Europe or other EU funding programmes), with specific focus on EU funded projects fostering PPI, with the aim of facilitating mutual learning and knowledge exchange and will also set up a pro-active dissemination action which will facilitate outreach to key target audiences, namely; public and private buyers, public-owned enterprises, SMEs and start-ups, research institutions among others.",

There is a need to close the performance gaps, which are still visible between Strong Innovators (North and West EU) and Moderate and Emerging Innovators (South and East EU mostly). A major asset to successful and sustainable business growth relies upon awareness and strong communication between innovative sectors and investors on available resources, their access and interventions by public/private funders. Improving networking between innovation ecosystems is key to the success of growing businesses and driving continued economic development.HER FUND’s ambition is to foster knowledge-sharing and synergies between innovation actors, existing initiatives/projects in order to support the next generation of startups, with an emphasis on women-led companies and gender-conscious investors. These interactions will notably lead to best practices’ identification, capacity-building activities and guidelines. Strengthening and broadening an interregional collaboration hub will promote a more competitive EU and a more sustainable, inclusive, diverse and resilient world.This will be done in a community-driven, cross-functional, cross-sectoral, multiplier based way, with partners bringing together communities of experts from different deep-tech sectors from around Europe and beyond. HER FUND will 1) transform less connected territories into recognized and attractive innovation valleys that pool and reward investments, 2) create bridges between EU innovation ecosystems increasing access to capital and investment in less connected innovation ecosystems and allowing local start-ups benefiting from foreign investments, 3) raise the number of gender conscious investors in Europe for support to women-led companies, 4) boost women entrepreneurship, especially in Moderate and Emerging Innovators offering them access to more funding opportunities",

         "Social innovation actors take on an important role in finding solutions for societal challenges. However, many social enterprises lack entrepreneurial skills and digitization of their products or services and there is still a lack of support for social entrepreneurs, which is due to the fact that many business support organisations have little understanding of the specific challenges and needs of social entrepreneurs. The social innovation and the technology innovation ecosystems are currently not well interconnected and mostly considered separate ecosystems with different skillsets. The POSITIVE project will counteract these factors by raising awareness about the benefits of social innovation and providing capacity building about social innovation and social entrepreneurship to the tech innovation ecosystem, thus creating the basis for better support for social entrepreneurs and a more inclusive innovation ecosystem based on mutual understanding. The project will also provide new opportunities for social entrepreneurs to digitise their products and services and to acquire new business skills through the organisation of an Open Innovation Challenge in three countries (POSITIVE Impact Challenge), which constitutes knowledge transfer from the tech into the social innovation ecosystem, with the specific purpose to support regional SI actors to access alternative means of financing. The POSITIVE project will also foster the interlinkage of the two ecosystems on a regional and European level through cross-fertilization, knowledge exchange and policy recommendations on how the POSITIVE Impact Challenge model can be replicated. Thus, the POSITIVE project can not only contribute to the strengthening of the social economy on different levels, but also make the tech innovation ecosystem more resilient and equipped to tackle the important societal challenges by including social innovation actors.",

In this context, ACCELERO – Accelerating Local Innovation Ecosystems in Europe aims at contributing to reverse the unbalanced business activity in Europe by increasing the attractiveness of (less advanced) ecosystems: making ‘modest’ and ‘moderate’ innovation ecosystems more attractive to local startups that will benefit from a strong local support and avoid relocation to EU hubs as well to international companies interested in setting up their businesses outside the established and well-known centres. It also aims at tapping into the potential of local ecosystems through co-designed programmes of activities proposed jointly by business acceleration entities located in less connected innovation ecosystems (‘modest’ and ‘moderate’) and innovation hubs (‘strong innovators’ and innovation leaders’), to improve the quality of business acceleration services, their network outreach and scale-up support. ACCELERO has the ambition of creating a pan-European community of business support organisations (BSOs) as the one-stop shop for all BSOs and its “customers”, the startups and SMEs, as well as for peer-to-peer exchange, networking and connectedness for all stakeholders engaged in the broader innovation ecosystem. This will be achieved with an initial ACCELERO extended community apart from consortium members to co-create and pilot-test high-quality business acceleration services with European BSOs from emerging and moderate innovators together with experts from strong and leader innovation regions or Member States, followed by the launch of the community inside Euroquity platform.",

         "How do longstanding, primarily non-industrial, non-capitalist societies adopt and adapt digital technologies in their daily practices and systems of values? Classical anthropological theory once arranged basic economic types on an evolutionary ladder ranging from hunter-gatherers, horticulturalists, pastoralists, and agriculturalists to industrialists. Today, the existence of these economies other than industrialism are correctly approached not as anachronisms but as contemporaneous to (post-)industrial life. Still, research on digitization has largely taken place in (post-) industrial contexts, meaning we know next to nothing about how different types of longstanding economies adopt and adapt digital technologies. At the same time, researchers have stipulated that digitization threatens global economic diversity. By comparing digitization to processes of colonization, they have argued that digital technologies facilitate assimilation into (post-)industrial economic systems and their often capitalist values by virtue of their technological design. This project empirically investigates these claims through in-depth ethnographic research among hunter-gatherers (Brazilian Amazon), pastoralists (Kyrgyz Republic), horticulturalists (Solomon Islands) and indigenous agriculturalists (India) who have long resisted assimilation into industrial-capitalism. Additional ethnological comparison of the four sites will offer unique macro-level insights into the possibilities for economic diversity in the digital age. Finally, the project advances a novel theoretical and methodological approach that advances both ethnographic research and ethnological comparison. This approach recognizes the significance of both technological design and contextual adaptations and provides tools for new research agendas not just on digital industrial-capitalism but on diverse economic systems and values.",

It is also the veil through which we peer into the extra-galactic universe. Its dust obscures our view of the formation of the cosmos. Its magnetic fields distort the observations of nature's most powerful particle accelerators. Its structure and metabolism determine the great diversity of observed star and planetary systems, including our own. Due to a lack of distance information, currently most information about the structure of the Milky Way is two-dimensional, while three-dimensional information is needed. For a breakthrough in Galactic cartography and the science it enables, we will create the first comprehensive three-dimensional atlas of all the physical components of the Milky Way. Our atlas will be self-consistent between component maps, quantify their remaining uncertainties, and be the most detailed to date. Thanks to the dramatic progress in observations at all wavelengths and in algorithmic methods based on information field theory in recent years, now is the right time to do this. Our team's combined expertise in galactic astrophysics, algorithms, observations, Milky Way surveys, and  information field theory with its application to galactic tomography puts us in a unique position to generate the first comprehensive Milky Way Atlas. We will apply this atlas to a number of pressing questions in cosmology, cosmic ray, and interstellar medium research and transfer the used tomography technologies into other areas, like medical imaging, Earth monitoring, and industrial data analysis.",

Its magnetic fields distort the observations of nature's most powerful particle accelerators. Its structure and metabolism determine the great diversity of observed star and planetary systems, including our own. Due to a lack of distance information, currently most information about the structure of the Milky Way is two-dimensional, while three-dimensional information is needed. For a breakthrough in Galactic cartography and the science it enables, we will create the first comprehensive three-dimensional atlas of all the physical components of the Milky Way. Our atlas will be self-consistent between component maps, quantify their remaining uncertainties, and be the most detailed to date. Thanks to the dramatic progress in observations at all wavelengths and in algorithmic methods based on information field theory in recent years, now is the right time to do this. Our team's combined expertise in galactic astrophysics, algorithms, observations, Milky Way surveys, and  information field theory with its application to galactic tomography puts us in a unique position to generate the first comprehensive Milky Way Atlas. We will apply this atlas to a number of pressing questions in cosmology, cosmic ray, and interstellar medium research and transfer the used tomography technologies into other areas, like medical imaging, Earth monitoring, and industrial data analysis.",

Luminescence nanosensing is a technology that promises all the features required to reliably monitor these parameters at the intracellular level: minimal invasiveness, remote working principle, and submicrometric spatial resolution. These features are ensured by the use of sub-micrometric sensors (particles) whose luminescence is sensitive to changes in the parameters to be sensed. Yet, despite the hype about luminescence nanosensing, its reliability in the study of cells is limited by interparticle variability in optical properties and sensing performance, simultaneous response to several parameters (cross-sensitivity), and lack of a measurement technology that enables fast 2D mapping of multiple parameters with sub-second temporal resolution. MAtCHLESS tackles heads on these limitations to develop a reliable luminescence sensing technology for multiparameteric sensing in cell studies. This project entails: design of a novel family of composite submicrometric luminescent sensors, elimination of interparticle fluctuations in optical properties using a spectral sorting strategy, introduction of the paradigm shift of making cross-sensitivity a desirable feature via machine learning, and use of a novel optical technology to build a setup for 2D mapping of multiple parameters with high temporal and spatial resolution. MAtCHLESS will test the reliability of the sensing approach in mammalian cell lines and extremophiles  microorganisms that can withstand extreme conditions of, e.g., temperature, oxygen concentration, and pH.

Even tiny deviations from GR would shake physics to its core, but to claim a deviation from it, one needs to filter out first the contributions from the astrophysical environment, instrumental artifacts and systematic modeling uncertainties. GWSky will provide tools to disentangle these contributions, enabling precision GW astronomy with upcoming observational runs, and new facilities on the ground and in space.",

         "ERC-2024-STG",
         "While newly printed books were circulating widely around Europe, when more than half a century had passed since Gutenbergs invention, Hernando Coln (1488-1539), second son of Christopher Columbus, undertook the extraordinary challenge of keeping physical track of the proliferation of knowledge. He not only purchased everything, incessantly, and everywhere, marking on the books place and date of purchase, the local price, and the conversion to Spanish currency; for accessing, managing and reusing his colossal library, he and his invisible technicians also developed a sophisticated cross-indexing and symbols system which is foundational in the history of bibliography and knowledge management. The Colombina library of Seville still preserves over one third of the almost 16,000 titles which Coln left at his death, as well a dozen manuscript indexes and catalogues that, recording all sorts of information, make it possible to reconstruct the lost portions of the collection, including the volumes famously shipwrecked on their way from Venice to Seville in 1521. Financing, gathering, cataloguing and managing a library of such scale required widespread connections, the support of an international network, and a vision deeply intertwined with the politics of knowledge acquisition of the new-born Spanish Empire. COLIBRI aims at opening the doors and explore the legacy of the most important library of the early modern period, completing the reconstruction of its content in order to investigate it; understanding how it worked as the first large-scale information processing system of modern times, and as a place for the production, not only for the storage and preservation, of knowledge; exploring the still new relationship between written and print culture and the early European and intercontinental book market; finally, showing how the movement and the stories of Colons books reflect the developments of Western culture of the last five centuries.",

         "The main objective of this Proposal is the organisation of the Young Talents Programme which contains two separate events. The first is the European Union Contest for Young Scientists (EUCYS) 2022. The second is the development of a pilot for next stage researchers & early career researchers with the working title EU TALENTON. Both events will be organized and held in Leiden, the Netherlands. Stichting Leiden European City of Science 2022 (Leiden2022) will be responsible for the organisation of the Young Talents Programme. The primary aim of the EU Contest for Young Scientists is to stimulate exchanges between talented young scientists, ensure that young scientists get guidance from some of the most prominent scientists in Europe and eventually to highlight scientific student achievements and attract widespread media interest. In other words, providing additional stimulus to young people who have an already demonstrated interest in applying science to solve problems.   In the 2022 edition, Leiden aims to innovate the existing EUCYS model in several ways. into a more attractive contest. Leiden2022 aims to innovate EUCYS2022 in the following ways:- Reviewing the EUCYS award system- Researching if the scope of EUCYS can be expanded towards components of the Humanities (from STEM to STEAM)- Embedding EUCYS into the public and scientific programme of Leiden European City of Science 2022 Furthermore Leiden2022 aims to reach a more mature target group that is entering the next level of their research career by organizing a pilot. With this pilots Leiden2022 will explore the possibilities for organizing the EU TALENTON, and as such create a (potential) blueprint for EU TALENTON editions to follow. Therefore, EUCYS2022 and the EU TALENTON 2022 have the potential to have long lasting impact on the future of the Young Talents Programme. With this new approach, a broader group of young people will be attracted to (academic) careers in STEM and/or STEAM fields. By giving special attention to future prospects of participants and competition winners both within and outside of academics, The Young Talents Programme is more than a scientific competition alone as it creates a broad career perspective for young students and next stage and early career researchers ranging in age between 14 and presumably 24. Therefore, the Young Talents Programme is an instrument to achieve broader impact on young talent and society beyond the competitions itself (and the events connected to it).",

         "The European Commission has made great strides in pushing for a more open scholarly publishing system in the past 15 years, and Open Access to publications is now mainstreamed into the European Commission research funding framework.  The EC has been supporting a consortium of research funders called cOAlition S that have adopted an Open Access mandate for recipients of their funding called Plan S, which required cOAlition S grantees to publish all peer-reviewed articles resulting from their grant funds in open access (OA).  In the five years since Plan S was published, cOAlition S has grown from 12 founding members to 28 and the Plan S Principles have been implemented in the participating funders’ policies. We are now in a position to evaluate the first five years of Plan S and cOAlition S, and reflect on lessons learned and the road ahead.The OA-Advance project will contribute to strengthening cOAlition S as an instrument to advance the European Commission’s and participating funders’ shared vision to deliver full and immediate OA.  It will work to achieve this by assessing the impact of Plan S through an independent review, and by providing recommendations on how to build on the achievements of Plan S to support a new vision for the future of scholarly publishing.",

This four missions will be implemented in Katowice by the end of 2024 together by the City of Katowice and the the Academic Consortium Katowice – City of Science, consisting of: Karol Szymanowski Academy of Music in Katowice, Academy of Fine Arts and Design in Katowice, Jerzy Kukuczka Academy of Physical Education, University of Economics in Katowice, Silesian University of Technology, Medical University of Silesia in Katowice, and University of Silesia in Katowice (leader of the consortium). The direct goal is to use science and higher education as a tool for transformation of the the City and region in order to improve the quality of life for the inhabitants  and to ensure dynamic development thorought the region of Silesia. We do not see the European City of Science 2024 title as an end in itself, but as a key step towards building Katowice as a Real City of Science – an agile, networked science centre operating across the whole of the city. Celebrations of the European City of Science 2024 provide an excellent opportunity to “disseminate” the City of Science concept, using this event as a base to create a real legacy project for the city itself and for all of Silesia. We are opening up our universities to create a world-class programme of societal engagement with science, technology and innovation. We are transforming Katowice into a city-wide science centre, generating unique possibilities and reinforcing competencies for the future of Silesia, Poland and Europe.",

Since RESAVER became operational it showed that it can operate in an efficient and successful way in a large number of countries providing pensions at a low cost. Building on this success, the most significant goal of RESAVER is now to strengthen own capacities and grow in size: we will highlight a number growth objectives (promotion, implementation, partnerships, marketing & sales support and awareness ranging among interested parties). We will also build upon and connected to a previous grant (https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101056649 Support to RESAVER Pension Fund - Horizon Europe (Horizon Europe WIDERA Work Programme 2021-2022)The more research institutions that join the RESAVER, the more effective it will be in removing pensions as a barrier to the mobility of researchers in Europe and the more it will fulfil its purpose of supporting the creation of a European Research Area, allowing for a free circulation of researchers, scientific knowledge and technology in execution of article 179 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).",

         "The objective of the project »ERA conference« is to create a space for stakeholders to engage with the formation of the  new, revitalised European Research Area (ERA) in order to pursue the European Commission's goals of co-designing, co-creating and co-developing ERA policies with all ERA actors. This delivers against the European Commission Communication from September 2020 on A new ERA for Research and Innovation and the Council Conclusions from December 2020 on the New European Research Area.The first day of the ERA conference focuses on the Commission’s proposal for a Council Recommendation on a Pact for Research and Innovation in Europe  and the new ERA governance structure. The second day will focus on implementation challenges with stakeholders.The expected impacts of the ERA conference are: a) contributing to the Commission’s co-creation of ERA Actions (derived from the ERA policy agenda), ensuring they are designed appropriately; and b) engaging stakeholders, by giving them their own space to discuss the implementation of several actions. The overall rationale of the ERA conference is based on the high level discussion on the topic of the renewal of the ERA and strengthening relations between stakeholders and the Commission (through workshop activities on the second day of the conference). The ERA conference will also deliver promotional activities prior to the conference – with stakeholder engagement through video testimonials on the topic of the renewal of the ERA, which will be publicised alongside the conference. Additionally, after the conference, the publication of conference recommendations will contribute to the balanced development of the new ERA and could be used in further ministerial discussions on the renewal of ERA. In the time of proposal writing it is planned for the conference to be held live, however we also have a support plan in case we would have to switch to online event due to the pandemics.",

         "The overall objective of CO-VALUE is to boost uptake and deployment of research results by adopting a co-valorisation approach that strengthens the role of societal actors in knowledge valorisation. Citizen engagement will be embedded in knowledge valorisation by deploying capacity building, peer learning actions and experimentation. CO-VALUE will capitalise on and contribute to EU initiatives such as the Knowledge Valorisation Platform, through the production, testing and improvement of best practices and lessons learned in two European territories: Alicante in Spain and Emilia Romagna in Italy. In each territory, quadruple-helix stakeholders from the research & innovation ecosystem will be involved in the co-design and implementation of co-valorisation, exploiting ongoing knowledge valorisation processes such as developing innovative solutions to address the lack of raw materials and its impact on citizens’ welfare (Alicante), or specific funding schemes and projects to introduce multi-stakeholder engagement in public-funded research (Emilia Romagna).The transfer of best practices and skills will be guaranteed by a comprehensive scheme of capacity building, peer learning and shadowing opportunities, both at local and international level. The involvement of umbrella organisations such as EBN, ERRIN and universities alliances will foster a wider uptake of CO-VALUE’s trainings and tools, thus supporting the implementation of new practices by knowledge valorisation agents beyond the project consortium. Incentives for researchers to engage with society, and for society to engage with researchers will be co-designed with stakeholders in each territory and implemented throughthe involvement of local R&I public administrations. Tangible changes in local co-valorisation agents will be exploited to showcase improvements, together with a co-assessment of enabling conditions, processes and impact performed together by all stakeholders involved.",

         "Addressing major societal challenges like climate change requires a very different approach to deploying innovation. EIT Climate-KIC has developed a practical model of place-based innovation to map, co-develop and match scalable solutions to the challenge of meeting city, region, and industry climate targets.  By orchestrating key stakeholders to develop new markets related to climate challenges and by enabling a large-scale ‘learning by doing’ framework, the model mobilises public and private funding to test and produce actionable intelligence, shared learning and solutions from a portfolio of innovations. There is a considerable need for such operational models for implementing transformative climate policy ambitions within Europe and beyond.EIT and EIT Climate-KIC have identified three core capabilities to enable scale up of this “systems innovation” model commercially and so help European stakeholders meet ambitious climate goals, aiming to contribute to the avoidance of over 500million tonnes CO2e and strengthening the climate resilience of 10 million people by 2027. This proposal addresses these core capabilities, comprising investment over 2 years of: €4.7M to secure new funding and commercial sales of the ‘Systems Innovation as a Service’ model; €5.8M to strengthen EIT Climate-KIC’s core operational capabilities and refine the systems innovation business model; and €6.3M to improve the quality and scalability of the systems innovation model to new national, city and regional governments, as well as industry sectors.The primary objective of this plan - against which success will be measured - is to ensure that by the end of 2024, EIT Climate-KIC is financially sustainable and independent of EIT funding and able to scale its systems innovation model.",

The cluster currently comprises a well established and successful EIT Hub in Israel and Silicon Valley, and an additional global platform dedicated to expanding the reach of EIT to new locations was established in 2023 as will be detailed in this business plan, under the new leadership of EIT Health. A new Hub will be established in the Uk as of January 2024.The Global Outreach programme creates significant value for the EIT Community, as well as the outreach location, with tangible success stories and concrete results from the past 4 years of activity. These stand to show the significant collaborations that have been forged in each outreach location, the impact of creating significant ties between Europe and these strategic global innovation valleys. The strong brand awareness that has been carefully crafted, and the intricate thought process that has been put into creating a strong foundation for each hub.This business plan for the next three years, 2023 - 2025 builds upon this strong foundation that has been established, and lays out the groundwork for further strengthening the existing Israel hub and creating a flexible and “on demand” global platform that will further expand EIT’s global footprint. The growth of the Global Outreach programme with an additional global platform with programmes in multiple locations will be based upon the scale of successful programmes that have a strong foundation, and adapting them to the needs and risks of the local ecosystems.The BP will show the strengthening and expansion of the Global Outreach programme stands in EIT’s best interests, connecting talents, knowledge and key players worldwide to tackle societal challenges.",

So far, we gathered a set of results showing the antimetastatic potential of our new drug which mode of action would, conceptually, be able to eliminate the deadliest feature of cancer cells – their ability to invade and metastasize. This happens because the target of our drug is the cells’ foundation (ie the cytoskeleton). Thus, destroying the cytoskeleton of cells is like shaking the foundations of a house, it will be tumble-down!With the Women TechEU program we will consolidate the proof-of-concept of the drug’s efficiency against metastases through two sets of in vivo studies in nude mice, and we will start the pre-clinical studies by performing pharmacokinetics (drug absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion). Also, in view of the natural future development of our drug we will start to develop its synthesis scale-up from the milligram to the multigram scale. Women TechEU program mentoring and coaching will be also key to consolidate our business plan and to approach partners and investors towards a fundraising Level A in the near future. This level of funding (~1 M€) will enable to finish our pre-clinical studies and place R-nuucell in the position to license its international patent, one of the company’s assets (PT108082B, EA038640B1, EP3227307B1, CN107466297B, JP6726678B2, US15/533,289, under examination on Canada, Brazil and India), to a pharmaceutical company using a “business-to-business” strategy.",

         "HORIZON-EIE-2022-SCALEUP-02-02",
         "More than 12 million people worldwide suffer from chronic wounds. These open wounds need to be treated in the long term, resulting in annual costs of €27 billion. The treatment of chronic wounds is based on recurring medical examinations at intervals of 4 weeks, which include photographic documentation and a measurement of the wound. According to the current state of the art, this is simply done with a ruler, whereby the ruler is often inserted directly into the wound to assess the depth of the wound. This method not only leads to unreliable and non-reproducible results. It also takes up to 30 min. and is associated with massive pain for patients. To provide patients with relief and efficiently support wound healing, cureVision has developed a unique primary care device that enables fast and accurate documentation and analysis of chronic wounds. Our device contains multiple cameras and detectors that fully automatical analyse seven critical parameters without touching the wound itself. In addition to the wound dimensions, the integrated AI also automatically and reliably analyses the tissue components of the wound (%). Thus, for the first time, our mobile primary care device enables fast and accurate assessment for every wound to enable clinicians to adjust the therapy early. In addition to the significantly more comfortable, non-invasive examination for the patient, our device reduces the examination time by up to 60 %. The optimised therapy will reduce both treatment time and hospitalisation rates, resulting in annual cost savings of over € 40 million in Germany alone. After producing a first working MVP, we now want to produce 50 final MVPs to test and verify the functions under real conditions and make adjustments based on user feedback. Before we go to market, our device must be approved as a medical product. In addition, we will set up a reliable data protection management system. These final steps are to be achieved within the outline of the present project.",

Its mission is to simplify and streamline monitoring in the European Open Science ecosystem, to bring a common understanding on how to collect and interpret data appropriate for monitoring, as well as to assist policymakers and research executives across Europe in understanding, shaping, and aligning Open Science and related policies and their implementation.Starting from the current EOSC Observatory developed during the EOSC Future project (TRL7), EOSC Track will transform the service into TRL9, making it an open, secure and trusted platform to serve as the go-to place for Open Science monitoring Europe. It will enhance it with features to improve usability, engagement and collaboration: automate data ingestion from trusted sources such as the OpenAIRE Graph, incorporate collaborative editing and validation of data, add interactive navigation and search, visualisations. It will complement with the EOS Resources Registry which will serve as a learning tool by including narratives from experts to demonstrate the internal processes towards the OS implementation in a country, and stories for impact or best practice.EOSC Track will explore the sustainability of the EOS Observatory by fostering a co-design process with the EOSC tripartite partnership and other interested stakeholders. The objective is to align various monitoring initiatives, offer practical assistance in data collection, and generate 360o reports to establish a de-facto hub for all information around monitoring Open Science and EOSC in Europe. Fast forwarding to 2027, EOSC Track will facilitate a dialogue with the EOSC tripartite Governance to develop a roadmap for ensuring long-term sustainability.",

         "HORIZON-EIE-2022-SCALEUP-02-02",
         "In cranial magnetic resonance tomography (cMRT), the administration of contrast agent facilitates diagnosis of various pathologies such as metastases due to contrast agent enhancement. Patients undergoing a medically indicated cMRT receive 100% of the authorized contrast agent dose, i.e., 0.1 mmol of gadolinium per kg body weight. The main component of MRT contrast agent is gadolinium, which is a highly toxic rare-earth element, which has potential health side effects (inter alia allergic reactions and accumulation in the body) as well as environmental side effects (accumulation in the tap water).Due to the aforementioned issues, the reduction of contrast agent dose in cMRT is highly desirable. To tackle this issue, Katerina Deike-Hofmann from the Clinic for Neuroradiology at the University Hospital Bonn together with colleagues and collaborators from the Institute of Mathematics and Life Sciences developed an artificial intelligence (AI)-based algorithm that allows for contrast agent reduction called SmartContrast. Until today, more than 1.000 prospective data sets were acquired at seven different clinics and SmartContrast showed excellent generalizibility. Thus, Katerina Deike-Hofmann founded the relios.vision GmbH as a spin-off of the University Bonn to commercialize SmartContrast. Her goal is to advance the clinical standard by combining knowledge from the areas of medicine, mathematical image processing, computer vision, and artificial intelligence.",
